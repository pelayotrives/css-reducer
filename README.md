# CSS Reducer

This Python script reduce CSS syntax and distribute it in a single line to fill less space in the file.

## Usage

No extra modules nor libraries required.

Modify the location of the input file and the name and location that you want it to have as output here:

    ```
    input_file_path = '../Desktop/example.css'
    output_file_path = '../Desktop/example_compiled.css'
    ```

Run the script by executing

    ```
    python3 css-reducer.py
    ```

The script will process the file and get a reduced CSS file that can be useful on certain occasions.

Enjoy!
